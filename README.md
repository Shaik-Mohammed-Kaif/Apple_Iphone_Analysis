## **1. Trendline Analysis (Sale Price vs. Number of Ratings)**  

### **Purpose**  
This chart helps understand the relationship between an Apple product’s sale price and its number of ratings. The data points represent individual products, while the trendline shows the overall pricing pattern.  

### **Insights**  
- If the trendline moves downward, it suggests that higher-rated products tend to be more affordable. This may indicate that customers prefer budget-friendly Apple products.  
- If the trendline moves upward, it shows that premium-priced products still receive high ratings, suggesting a strong brand loyalty.  
- A sudden increase in ratings at a particular price point can help Apple determine the ideal pricing strategy for new product launches.

## **2. Candlestick Chart Analysis (Apple Stock Prices: MRP vs. Sale Price)**  

### **Purpose**  
This chart mimics stock market visualization but applies it to Apple’s product pricing trends. The candlestick format represents price fluctuations over time, with green bars indicating price increases and red bars indicating price drops.  

### **Insights**  
- A series of green candlesticks suggests that Apple maintains high prices without significant discounting, which reflects strong brand positioning.  
- Multiple red candlesticks indicate frequent price reductions, likely due to sales campaigns, lower demand, or inventory clearance.  
- Sudden price dips followed by recoveries may suggest seasonal discounts, such as Black Friday or the launch of a new iPhone model.  
- Comparing different iPhone models using this method can reveal demand trends and guide future pricing strategies.
